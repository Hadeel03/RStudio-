## RStudio
* Object assignment operator (MAC shortcut):
  * option + gives â‰ 
  * option - gives <- 
* R is case-sensitive 
  * For example My_apples will cause Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos):                   object'My_apples' not found
* If something comes in quotes, it is not defined in R 
* To get help use ? followed by function or object 
-tidyverse_style_guide
  - After function names do not leave any spaces 
  - Before & after operators leave spaces 
  - Put a space after a comma not before
  - Object names are all lower case, with words separated by an underscore
* If you want to add code inside a quarto document do this
    
```{r}
print("hello woRld!!!")
```

# Getting to know data
## Data Sample
![](data_sample.png)
## Data Matrices
  * Variables <- 8 (state, num_drivers, perc_speeding, perc_not_distracted, perc_no_previous, insurance_premiums, losses). AKA the number of columns!
  * Cases or observations <- 51 (# of states). AKA the number of rows! 
* Some important functions:
  * you can pass a second parameter to choose the # of rows to display
  * head() displays the first few rows
  * tail() displays the last few rows
  * glimpse() displays the # of rows and columns, the type of each column, and the first few values of each column horizontally.
